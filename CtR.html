            <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> 
                The enormous statue of Jesus known as Christ the Redeemer, which is perched atop Rio de Janeiro's breathtaking 
                Mount Corcovado, is more than just a work of art. Its origins may be found in the years following World War I,
                when worries over a supposedly spreading "tide of godlessness" touched the emotions of many Brazilians.
                A bold suggestion—a commanding monument that served as a symbol of faith and supernatural comfort—arose in 
                response. This enormous work of art was created via the combined vision of three talented artists, 
                Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski.A tribute of human perseverance and creativity, 
                construction started in 1926 and was completed five years later. Without taking into consideration its enormous 
                26-foot (8-meter) foundation, the monument, which is a representation of spiritual guidance, climbs to a height 
                of 98 feet (30 meters). Astonishingly, the kind gesture of its spread arms spans 92 feet (28 meters).  
            </br>
                Beyond its enormous size, Christ the Redeemer is acknowledged as the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world—a 
                symbol of sophisticated design and architecture. It is made of reinforced concrete and covered in around six 
                million tiles, and it serves as a symbol of both human ingenuity and spiritual awe. A reminder that even in 
                the presence of divinity, the forces of nature continue to mold and test this enduring symbol of faith, hope, 
                and divine protection is the fact that this towering figure has faced the capriciousness of nature and withstood 
                the force of lightning.
